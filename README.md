# E-commerce 

## Description:

- Why build a E-commerce website?

    Well I'll tell you why! It is a large part of how we do transactons and will only grow in the future. Fintech is a huge sector and is becoming more popular with businesses as well as consumers.

- What was the problem solved?

    The problem that I solved was creating the back end environment for the site. Using an express.js API and sequelize I was able to interact with a MySQL database and make the application functional.

- What did I learn?

    I gained a better understanding of Express.js and also using a database.
